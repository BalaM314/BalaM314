## Programming languages I know

Really well:

* Typescript: MOST EPIC LANGUAGE OF ALL TIME
* HTML: definitely a programming language

Decently:
* CSS: is extremely painful
* Java: not as bad as I thought it was.
* Python: yes I am the only person in the entire universe that doesn't like python.
* I made stuff on an arduino a long time back so I technically know C?
* Rust: am still learning it. Looks really good.
* mlogx: I put my own language here lol
