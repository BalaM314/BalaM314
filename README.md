# Hello, I'm BalaM314!
Javascript developer making cool stuff.
## Projects
* Untitled Electron Game: epic factory building game that's in early alpha.
* Einsteinium: a NuclearCraft reactor planner
* Omnifactory Tweaked: a fork of the Omnifactory minecraft modpack with tweaks that I like.
* TestMod1: a Minecraft meme mod.
* ComplexGrapher: a "graphing calculator" for complex numbers. Hard to understand, but definitely looks cool.
* Interstellar: an awesome Discord theme.
## Programming languages I know

Really well:
* Javascript: second best language of all time
* Typescript: MOST EPIC LANGUAGE OF ALL TIME
* HTML: definitely a programming language
Decently:
* Java: not as bad as I thought it was.
* Python: yes I am the only person in the entire universe that doesn't like python.
I made stuff on an arduino a long time back so I technically know C?
